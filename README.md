##Challenge #3 Mobile Healthcare Boarding Pass (Christiana Care Health System)


**Solve For:** A healthcare system that wants to explore more efficient and integrated administrative processes for patients.


**Example Solution Direction:** Create a patient-facing mobile app to that combines appointment scheduling, patient-onboarding and basic CRM functions.


**Use-Case Overview:** In today’s highly-connected world of personal/mobile devices, industries have found new ways to streamline previously time-intensive and monotonous routines. These maturing technologies have been a platform to improve efficiency and user experience for both companies and customers. Air travel is one industry that has transformed the user experience. A user is able to pre-register, search for, select, manage, and expedite their check-in and boarding all using a mobile device. Subsequent travel is then further streamlined by reusing existing user data to plan new trips. The Boarding Pass challenge asks you to apply this approach to health care. Create an application that allows users to coordinate and improve their health care experience. Improve efficiency by allowing users to do things like: search providers, schedule and manage appointments, pre-register by filling out forms (reusing common data, and common forms, from one appointment to the next), and expedite the check in process once they arrive to see their doctor.


Below are some ideas to think about, but focus on the idea(s) that would most improve your own experience navigating and managing health care interactions:

1. Find providers (with helpful search criteria – type of practice, availability, location to you, etc.) and schedule appointments
2. Get appointment and paperwork reminders
Experience ‘Boarding Pass’ activities such as:
confirming your scheduled appointment or getting the option to reschedule
3. confirming and editing your demographic data
4. completing pre-procedure or pre-visit questionnaires
5. signing consent for treatment forms
6. Upload photos of your insurance card, photo ID & order/referral forms
7. Upload forms, such as school physicals, for completion by the 
8. clinician during the next visit
9. Complete medication reconciliation at home, either by checking off & editing medications pre-loaded from the last visit, or uploading photos of pill bottles
10. Enable text reminders for people in your circle of care e.g. the person who will be giving you a ride to the appointment
11. Facilitate the check-in process when you arrive for your scheduled appointment
12. Be creative and select any or all of these ideas for your app – or come up with your own.
